# UWNMR-pulse-sequences
These pulse sequences will be periodically updated, and represent our best standardized versions.
We also will be placing "starter kits" here in the near future.  
These will be recommended starting parameters, TopSpin files, standard recommendations, and general advice on getting started with ultra-wideline NMR experiments.
Feel free to contact Jimmy Kimball and myself for the latest versions and advice!

## Requirements
Topspin 4.0 or higher (pulse sequences for earlier versions of TopSpin may be available upon request).

## Support
These pulse sequences were developed with support (in part) by the National Science Foundation Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, with partial co-funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program (NSF-2003854).
